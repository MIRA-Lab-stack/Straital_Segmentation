# Straital_Segmentation

This project uses a Multi-Task Learning network for striatal segmentation using T1 MRI images as input.

The following code will be available once the manuscript "Multi-Task Learning based 3-Dimensional Striatal Segmentation of MRI – a Multi-modal Objective Assessment"
has been accepted.

If there are any questions in the implementation of the code, pelase email miralab.sbu@gmail.com
